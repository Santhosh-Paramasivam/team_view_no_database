# CampusFind - A solution to quickly locate fellow employees and teammates

# 🔍 The Problem

Have you ever spent valuable time searching for a teammate across a sprawling institution? Phone calls and messages often interrupt workflows, while coordinating large teams quickly can feel impossible.

# 💡 The Solution

After having to spend hours looking for professors and heads of departments on busy days for signatures and permissions, I created an app where you can look up people in an institution from a couple taps on your mobile device!

# CampusFind offers a seamless way to:

✅ Instantly locate colleagues with real-time, interactive floor maps.
✅ Set and update your own location with ease.
✅ Look at the events and attendees in each room
✅ Use RFID stations for quick, automated check-ins and check-outs.
✅ Display your availability status for efficient and respectful collaboration.
